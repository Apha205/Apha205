<h1 align="center">Hi, I‚Äôm Apha üëã</h1>

<p align="center">
  I build *intelligent, data-driven systems* that live at the intersection of *Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Engineering, and Web3
</p>
---

### üõ†Ô∏è What I'm Building

- *Python Engineering* ‚Äì Clean, production-grade code, performant algorithms, async/multiprocessing, and rigorous testing.
- *Data Engineering* ‚Äì SQL & NoSQL design, ETL pipelines, big-data processing with Pandas, Spark, and modern file formats (Parquet, Avro).
- *Machine Learning & AI* ‚Äì From classical ML to deep learning with PyTorch and Hugging Face.  
  Special focus on *computer vision* and *video intelligence* (ffmpeg, OpenCV, perceptual hashing).
- *Web3 & Decentralized AI* ‚Äì Smart contracts (Solidity/Rust), decentralized storage (IPFS/Crust), and on-chain integrations that let AI models live and evolve on decentralized networks.
- *Systems Thinking* ‚Äì Big-O analysis, distributed design, and scalable architectures for massive datasets.

## üí° Key Projects
- *AI Video Summarizer* ‚Äì End-to-end system that ingests raw video, analyzes scenes, and stores summaries on IPFS.
- *Decentralized AI API* ‚Äì On-chain token-gated API serving trained ML models, combining FastAPI and smart contracts.
- *Data Pipelines at Scale* ‚Äì High-throughput ETL processes handling terabytes of structured and unstructured data.
