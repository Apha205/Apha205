### Who I Am

- 🧑‍💻 I’m a hands-on developer obsessed with learning how everything works — from backend APIs to AI pipelines.
- 🛠️ I work mostly with Python, FastAPI, full-stack dev tools, and AI model integrations.
- 🔭 Exploring AI vision models, tagging engines, decentralized systems, and open-source tech.
- 📈 I believe in iteration, momentum, and building *real things* that ship.

### 🛠️ What I'm Learning & Building

- 🧪 Building engines that process and understand video through local vision-language models (VLMs).
- 📦 Packaging tools that combine AI, web tech, and automation.
- ⚙️ Automating workflows, writing backend logic, and deploying smart solutions on a budget.
- 💻 Running everything locally — API servers, LLMs, VLMs — even if it breaks 3x first.
